\section{Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis}

\subsection{Sensitivity}
Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying key parameters and observing the effects on model outputs. Identify which parameters have the most significant impact.
\subsection{Robustness}
Evaluate the robustness of the model by testing its performance under different disturbance scenarios, such as outlier contamination and temporal distribution shifts.
